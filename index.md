<span style="font-family:'Candara Light';">
I am a second year CS Ph.D. student at Stanford University, where I work on security and cryptography research. I am advised by [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).
</span>

<span style="font-family:'Candara Light';">
Prior to joining Stanford, I completed my Masters in May 2021 from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where I built Catan, a CPU scheduling framework for Robotics & AR/VR. I was advised by [Radhika Mittal](http://radhikam.web.illinois.edu/) and [Brighten Godfrey](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/). In the summer of 2021, I interned at Microsoft Research with the [RFI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/) group, where I worked with [Ranveer Chandra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ranveer/) and [Anirudh Badam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/anbadam/) on leveraging AI to improve agricultural crop production.

<span style="font-family:'Candara Light';">
A little more history - I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in 2018 where I worked with [Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/) and [Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/) on large scale question answering using tourism data. I pursued an internship with [Dina Katabi](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/dina-katabi) in the summer of 2018, during which I worked on enhancing reliability of [Emerald](https://www.emeraldinno.com/), a globally distributed IoT system. I also worked as a software engineer in the [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) team at Microsoft Vancouver for a year before joining UIUC.

Apart from work, I enjoy cooking, travelling and learning random things via Twitter :)
