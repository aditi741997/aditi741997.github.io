<span style="font-family:Georgia;">
I am a fifth year CS Ph.D. student at Stanford University, where I work on cryptography research. I am advised by [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/). My current focus is on accountability in threshold cryptography and leader election protocols.
</span>

<span style="font-family:Georgia;">
Prior to joining Stanford, I completed my Masters in May 2021 from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in 2018. 
<!-- where I built Catan, a CPU scheduling framework for Robotics & AR/VR. I was advised by [Radhika Mittal](http://radhikam.web.illinois.edu/) and [Brighten Godfrey](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/). In the summer of 2021, I interned at Microsoft Research with the [RFI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/) group, where I worked with [Ranveer Chandra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ranveer/) and [Anirudh Badam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/anbadam/).  -->

A little more history - I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in 2018. I pursued an internship with [Dina Katabi](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/dina-katabi) in the summer of 2018, during which I worked on 
[Emerald](https://www.emeraldinno.com/).

<span style="font-family:Georgia;">
Apart from work, I enjoy reading, travelling and social dancing.
